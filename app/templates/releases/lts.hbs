<h2>What is an LTS release?</h2>

<p>
  Once a release of Ember gets promoted to LTS, it receives <strong>bugfixes for 36 weeks</strong> and <strong>security updates for 54 weeks</strong>.
</p>

<p>
  An LTS release is the best version to use if you won't be updating your app frequently, but want to help your app stay secure and working smoothly.

  Another reason to use an LTS is if you have a very large, complex app, since LTS versions get even more testing and scrutiny than usual.
</p>

<p>
  An LTS is declared roughly every 4 minor versions, excluding the x.0 minor version.

  The last minor version before the next major release is also considered to be an LTS.

  For example, in Ember 2.x, the following versions were considered LTS's: 2.4, 2.8, 2.12, 2.16, and 2.18 (last version).
</p>

<p>
  Before a version can be called an "LTS" release, it has to spend at least 6 weeks as a stable release, where it is used and tested by thousands of developers.
</p>

<h2>LTS schedule</h2>

<p>
  Ember currently supports these LTS versions for Ember.js and Ember Data.
</p>

<p>
  <EsNote @mascot="zoey">EmberData made updates to its versioning strategy that mean it may maintain separate LTS versions from Ember.js. You can read more about the updates on the <a href="https://blog.emberjs.com/updates-to-ember-data-versioning-strategy">Ember Blog</a>.</EsNote>
